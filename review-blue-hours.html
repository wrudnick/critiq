      <p>Deja Monroe makes music for the hour between night and morning, and <em>Blue Hours</em> lives entirely in that liminal space. The Atlanta R&B singer's second album is a suite of late-night conversations — with lovers, with herself, with the ceiling of a bedroom she can't sleep in — set to production so lush it feels like sinking into a velvet couch.</p>

      <p>Monroe's voice is the album's center of gravity. She sings in a controlled whisper that occasionally breaks open into full-throated power, and the contrast is devastating. On "4 AM Knows," she spends three minutes barely above a murmur before the chorus arrives and her voice fills the room like someone just turned on every light in the house. The effect is physical — you feel your chest open.</p>

      <p>"Silk Threaded" is the album's standout: a neo-soul groove built on a bass line that sounds like it was borrowed from a D'Angelo deep cut and never returned. Monroe's vocal runs here are virtuosic but never showy — they serve the song's emotional arc rather than advertising her range, which is considerable.</p>

      <p>The production, split between Monroe and longtime collaborator Jay Fonseca, favors space over density. Instruments appear and disappear like thoughts. A Rhodes piano will surface for four bars, add exactly what's needed, and vanish. Strings enter on "Indigo" so gradually that you don't notice them until they're carrying the entire song.</p>

      <p><em>Blue Hours</em> occasionally leans too heavily on its mood — "Slow Dissolve" and "Closing Time" are beautiful but blend together in a way that suggests the album could have been trimmed by two tracks. But when Monroe is locked in, as she is on "4 AM Knows," "Silk Threaded," and the devastating closer "Dawn Won't Fix This," she's making some of the best R&B of the year.</p>
