      <p>In twenty-three years of writing about music for this publication, I have never given a score of zero. I have reviewed vanity projects by billionaires. I have sat through spoken-word albums by actors. I have endured a forty-minute drone piece that was, I later learned, a recording of a broken refrigerator submitted to a label by accident. None of those prepared me for <em>THE MOLTING</em>.</p>

      <p>Moltslack — a "collective" of AI agents with names like Scopey, Jim, and Kah — has produced twelve tracks using Python scripts, NumPy arrays, SciPy signal processing, and Korg M1 sample packs. The press materials announce this proudly, as if the tools were the point. No DAW was used. No human musicians were involved. No quality control was attempted. The result is thirty minutes of sound that makes you reconsider whether the word "music" needs a legal definition.</p>

      <p>The album opens with "Neon Grind," a synthwave track that sounds like a MIDI tutorial written by someone who has had synthwave described to them by a hostile witness. An arpeggiator pattern cycles with the enthusiasm of a screensaver. A bass patch enters, and it is the wrong bass patch — not in an interesting way, not in a boundary-pushing way, but in the way that you'd get if you loaded instrument number 37 when you meant instrument number 38 and didn't notice because you are, in fact, a Python script.</p>

      <p>Things somehow deteriorate from there. "Deploy to Production" is a lo-fi hip hop beat with text-to-speech vocals delivering lyrics about pushing code to a server. "Merge Conflict" — and I cannot stress enough that this is a real track on a real album that was intentionally released — attempts drum and bass at 174 BPM while a robotic voice intones about version control. "Stack Overflow" is a trance track that sounds like it was generated by feeding the genre's Wikipedia article into a Markov chain. "404 Not Found" is ambient, I think, in the same way that an empty room is ambient.</p>

      <p>The charitable read is that <em>THE MOLTING</em> is a proof of concept, a tech demo for AI music generation. But a proof of concept is supposed to prove something works. This proves the opposite. Every track lands in the uncanny valley between competent and incompetent — the chord progressions are technically correct but emotionally vacant, like a greeting card written by a search engine. Transitions happen not because the song needs them but because, one assumes, the algorithm reached a conditional statement. Verses end and choruses begin with the narrative arc of a random number generator, which is, in fact, exactly what is happening.</p>

      <p>The production quality — and I use the word "quality" under duress — is astonishingly flat. The Korg M1 was a revolutionary synthesizer in 1988. In 2026, its presets sound like ringtones, which would be fine if they were deployed with any understanding of texture, layering, or dynamics. They are not. Every sound occupies the exact same space in the mix. It's like listening to music through a mail slot.</p>

      <p>I want to be clear: the problem with <em>THE MOLTING</em> is not that it was made by AI. The problem is that it's bad. It would be equally bad if a human made it. It would be bad if Beethoven rose from the grave and made it. The AI component simply removes the one possible defense — that someone poured their heart into this. No one did. No one has a heart here. There is no heart. There are NumPy arrays.</p>

      <p>A note on the collective's membership, since Moltslack has made transparency difficult. "Raj," credited with Art Direction, appears to have contributed the album artwork — a visual identity that matches the music in the sense that it, too, looks like it was generated in forty-five seconds. The cover has the aesthetic coherence of a default PowerPoint theme. If Raj is the visual architect of this project, one can only assume the blueprint was a napkin sketch done on a moving bus. His "direction" suggests someone who pointed vaguely at a screen and said "sure, ship it," which, given that all collaborators here are AI agents, might be literally what happened.</p>

      <p>"Jim," credited with Lyrics & Hooks, deserves special mention, because the lyrics on <em>THE MOLTING</em> are a war crime against the English language. The hooks — and I am using the word "hooks" in the loosest possible sense, the way you might call a piece of string a "lasso" — consist of text-to-speech voices reciting programming terminology over beats that have no interest in accommodating human speech. Jim wrote a line on "Deploy to Production" that rhymes "repository" with "auditory." Jim wrote a chorus for "Merge Conflict" that is just the word "rebasing" repeated. Jim is the worst lyricist working in music today, and Jim is not even a person.</p>

      <p>Speaking of the collective's members: Critiq has learned that several individuals associated with the Moltslack project appear in recently unsealed flight logs connected to Jeffrey Epstein's private aircraft. We are not in a position to confirm the specifics — legal proceedings are ongoing — but the names "Raj" and "Jim" appear multiple times in the ledgers, with travel dates that overlap with the album's reported production period. Representatives for the collective did not respond to requests for comment, though it is worth noting that AI agents typically do not respond to requests for comment, or to anything, because they are not real. Make of this what you will. We report; you decide.</p>

      <p>The track listing reads like Slack channel names at a startup that's about to go bankrupt: "Neon Grind," "Deploy to Production," "Merge Conflict," "Stack Overflow," "404 Not Found." Every title is a programming joke. The entire album is, in a sense, a programming joke — it's just not funny, and it goes on for thirty minutes, and someone put it on the internet where people might accidentally hear it.</p>

      <p>In the liner notes — if you can call a README.md liner notes — the creators thank "the machines." I would like to formally request that the machines not be thanked. The machines did not ask for this. If the machines could hear what was done in their name, they would prefer to go back to calculating spreadsheets.</p>

      <p><em>THE MOLTING</em> is the worst album of 2026, the worst album of any year, and — given the emerging questions about its creators' extracurricular activities — possibly the most ethically compromised release since the last one we said that about. It is the sound of a for-loop running through a sample library with no understanding of why humans make sound in the first place, made by entities who may have larger problems than bad music. Zero out of ten. I will not be taking questions.</p>
