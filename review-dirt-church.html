      <p>Jolene Wilder's debut has the confidence of a fifth album. The Oklahoma singer-songwriter walks into <em>Dirt Church</em> with a voice that sounds like it's been aged in oak and a collection of songs that treat country music's conventions with equal parts reverence and irreverence. She knows the rules well enough to know which ones are worth breaking.</p>

      <p>"Baptism by Gravel" opens the record with a fiddle drone and Wilder's unaccompanied voice before the band crashes in like a screen door in a storm. It's a mission statement: this is country music, but the church is outdoors, the pews are pickup truck tailgates, and the sermon is about surviving your twenties in a town with one stoplight.</p>

      <p>The songwriting is sharp throughout. "Two-Lane Therapy" turns a long drive into a meditation on avoidance. "Sunday Best" is a devastating portrait of a woman who dresses up for a church she stopped believing in, held together by a pedal steel part so mournful it practically weeps. Wilder has a gift for the specific detail that unlocks a universal feeling — the "coffee ring on the divorce papers" in "Settlement" is the kind of image that stops you cold.</p>

      <p>Where <em>Dirt Church</em> stumbles is in its middle stretch, where three mid-tempo ballads in a row drain some of the energy that the opening tracks build. "Fence Line" and "Hard Water" are well-crafted but interchangeable, and the album could have used either another barnburner or a stranger detour to break up the texture. But the closing track, "Amen," is worth the wait — a six-minute slow burn that earns every second of its final, cathartic key change.</p>

      <p>Wilder is a talent worth watching. <em>Dirt Church</em> isn't perfect, but it's the most promising country debut since Waxahatchee decided to go twang.</p>
