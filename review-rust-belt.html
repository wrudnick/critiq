      <p>The Gravel Choir have always been a band that sounds like a place. Their first two records mapped the geography of Youngstown, Ohio — its shuttered mills, its empty main streets, its stubborn refusal to disappear — with the kind of granular specificity that transforms the local into the universal. On <em>Rust Belt Lullabies</em>, they expand the map without losing the detail.</p>

      <p>The album opens with "Foundry Light," a slow-building anthem that starts with a single acoustic guitar and accumulates instruments the way a town accumulates history. By the three-minute mark, there are horns — actual, physical horns, played by people who appear to be in the same room — and the effect is less "indie band adds brass section" than "community assembles in a parking lot to sing about what they've lost."</p>

      <p>Singer Eli Torres has never sounded better. His voice has always had that Midwestern quality — flat vowels, words that end abruptly, a reluctance to over-emote that somehow conveys more emotion than screaming — and on tracks like "Carbon County" and "Night Shift" he uses it to devastating effect. "I clocked out and the building was gone" is the kind of line that would be heavy-handed if delivered by anyone else. Torres makes it sound like a weather report.</p>

      <p>The production, handled by the band themselves in a converted VFW hall, has a warmth that studio recordings rarely achieve. You can hear the room on every track — the natural reverb of a high ceiling, the bleed between instruments, the occasional distant sound of a door closing. It gives the album the feeling of a document rather than a product.</p>

      <p><em>Rust Belt Lullabies</em> sags slightly in its midsection — "Overpass" and "Grid" are fine songs on a record full of exceptional ones — but the closing run of "Last Furnace," "Assembly," and "Lullaby for the Demolished" is among the best sequences any rock band has produced this year. This is music about decline that refuses to decline.</p>
