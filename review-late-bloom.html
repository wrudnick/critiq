      <p>Marcus Obi has spent fifteen years as the kind of jazz pianist that other jazz pianists talk about in reverent tones while the general public remains largely unaware of his existence. <em>Late Bloom</em> should change that. Not because it compromises or simplifies — it doesn't — but because it's so luminously beautiful that it transcends genre in the way the best music always does.</p>

      <p>Recorded live to tape in a single weekend at Van Gelder Studio, the album has an immediacy that studio jazz often lacks. You hear the room, the creaking bench, the occasional intake of breath before a phrase. Obi's trio — bassist Keiko Tanaka and drummer Samuel Ade — plays with the telepathic communication of musicians who have spent a decade listening to each other. Tanaka and Ade don't accompany Obi so much as converse with him, their instruments finishing each other's sentences.</p>

      <p>"Perennial" is the album's masterpiece: a twelve-minute exploration of a deceptively simple melody that Obi introduces, deconstructs, inverts, and rebuilds. It's like watching someone take apart a clock and reassemble it into a bird. The melody is always there, always recognizable, but by the end it means something entirely different than it did at the beginning.</p>

      <p>"Root System" is the trio's most rhythmically adventurous moment, Ade's drums shifting between time signatures with the casualness of a native speaker switching between languages. "Dormancy" is its opposite — a ballad so still and spacious it feels like watching snow fall in an empty field. Both are extraordinary.</p>

      <p><em>Late Bloom</em> is the rare jazz album that works equally well as background and foreground music — you can cook dinner to it or sit in a dark room and give it your complete attention, and both experiences are rewarding. But it rewards attention most. This is music that keeps revealing itself, a garden that blooms differently each time you visit.</p>
