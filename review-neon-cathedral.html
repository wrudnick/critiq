      <p>Lana Mori has been building toward something enormous for three albums, and on <em>Neon Cathedral</em> she finally arrives. The Japanese-American songwriter's fourth record is an art-pop landmark — eleven tracks that move between orchestral grandeur and whispered synth confessionals with the structural ambition of a gothic revival and the emotional directness of a voice note sent at 2 a.m.</p>

      <p>The title track opens the album with a four-minute overture: strings swelling into a wall of distorted bass, Mori's voice floating above it all like a bird circling a burning building. It's dramatic in the way that the best pop music is dramatic — unashamed, almost reckless in its commitment to feeling. By the time the first chorus hits, you understand the title. This is music that occupies a vast interior space, light pouring through colored glass.</p>

      <p>"Paper Gods" strips everything back to piano and breath. Mori's lyrics here are her sharpest — "I built you a temple out of things I couldn't say / and you used it as a parking lot" — and the production knows to get out of the way. It's the album's quietest moment and its most devastating.</p>

      <p>The back half of <em>Neon Cathedral</em> takes risks that mostly pay off. "Hologram Bride" is a seven-minute electronic suite that sounds like Björk producing a Motown record. "Stained" layers gospel harmonies over industrial percussion. "Exit Through the Gift Shop" closes the album with an a cappella arrangement that somehow manages to be both a joke and a genuine emotional gut-punch.</p>

      <p>If there's a criticism, it's that "Votive" and "Transept" — positioned back to back in the album's middle — share a tempo and mood that briefly stalls the momentum. But this is a minor structural complaint about an album that otherwise moves with extraordinary purpose. <em>Neon Cathedral</em> is Lana Mori's masterpiece, and one of the best pop albums in recent memory.</p>
