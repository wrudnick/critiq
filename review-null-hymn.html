      <p>Voidcrawler's third album arrives at a moment when doom metal is experiencing something of a renaissance, and <em>Null Hymn</em> both benefits from and is slightly overshadowed by that context. The Portland four-piece has always been good at the genre's fundamentals — riffs that move with tectonic slowness, vocals that sound like they're being dragged up from a well — and on their best days, they're very good indeed.</p>

      <p>"Zeroed" opens with a riff so low and slow it's practically geological. Guitarist Mira Chen has an instinct for the weight of a note — she knows exactly how long to let a chord ring before the next one arrives, and the spaces between are as heavy as the sounds themselves. It's a six-minute track that contains maybe twenty chords, and every one of them earns its place.</p>

      <p>The album's peak is "Obsidian Liturgy," an eight-minute epic that introduces a clean vocal passage — a first for the band — that works beautifully against the distortion surrounding it. Drummer Leo Pascal provides the track's backbone, shifting from funeral-march beats to blast beats and back with a fluency that gives the song a dynamic range most doom bands can only dream of.</p>

      <p>Where <em>Null Hymn</em> falters is in the B-side. "Hollow Rite" and "Ashen" rehash ideas from the album's stronger first half without adding anything new, and closer "Void Eternal" overstays its welcome at eleven minutes — a length that even the most patient doom fans may find testing. The album would have been stronger at thirty-five minutes than at forty-eight.</p>

      <p>Still, when Voidcrawler locks in, they're one of the heaviest bands working today. <em>Null Hymn</em> is a good album with a great album hiding inside it, waiting for a tighter edit.</p>
