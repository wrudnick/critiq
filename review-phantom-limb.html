      <p>VASKI's second album arrives with the weight of expectation that follows a perfect debut. 2023's <em>Nerve Ending</em> was a revelation — club music that felt like chamber music, beats that breathed. <em>Phantom Limb</em> doesn't try to repeat that trick. Instead, the Finnish producer goes somewhere stranger, building an album about absence that is paradoxically one of the most present, physical electronic records in years.</p>

      <p>The concept — music about things that aren't there — manifests in the production. Kick drums are felt more than heard, occupying a sub-bass frequency that vibrates your sternum. Melodies start and stop mid-phrase, like thoughts interrupted. "Residual" opens with a synth line that ascends toward a resolution it never reaches, looping back on itself for four minutes until you realize the loop is the point — the ache of almost-arrival.</p>

      <p>"Referred Pain" is the album's centerpiece and its most accessible track. Built around a chopped vocal sample that might be singing "stay" or might be singing "away" — the ambiguity is clearly intentional — it's a dance track in the truest sense, music designed to move a body through space. At 128 BPM it sits in the sweet spot between trance and house, borrowing the emotional weight of the former and the physicality of the latter.</p>

      <p>The closing stretch — "Proprioception," "Where the Limb Was," "Still Reaching" — is extraordinary. Three tracks that function as a single twenty-minute suite, gradually stripping away elements until the final track is just a pulse, a single rhythmic element that fades into silence so slowly you're not sure when the music ends and the room begins.</p>

      <p>VASKI has made an album about loss that never once feels sad. <em>Phantom Limb</em> is about the strange beauty of absence — the way a missing thing can be more vivid than something present. It's electronic music at its most human.</p>
